Fine-Tuning Palm Model with LangChain
This repository provides a guide and code for fine-tuning the Palm model using LangChain. The Palm model is a powerful language model, and fine-tuning allows you to adapt it to specific tasks or domains.

Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

Python 3.6 or later
TensorFlow 2.x
LangChain library
You can install the required dependencies using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Dataset Preparation
Prepare your fine-tuning dataset. The dataset should be organized with a structure suitable for your task. Modify the prepare_dataset.py script to suit your data preprocessing needs.

bash
Copy code
python prepare_dataset.py
Fine-Tuning
Run the fine-tuning script to fine-tune the Palm model on your dataset.

bash
Copy code
python fine_tune.py --dataset_path /path/to/dataset --output_model_path /path/to/save/model
Adjust the command-line arguments as needed, such as specifying the learning rate, batch size, and other hyperparameters.

Inference with Fine-Tuned Model
Once fine-tuning is complete, you can use the fine-tuned model for inference. Modify the inference.py script to suit your specific use case.

bash
Copy code
python inference.py --model_path /path/to/fine_tuned_model --input_text "Your input text here."
LangChain Integration
LangChain is seamlessly integrated into the fine-tuning process, providing a convenient and efficient way to work with the Palm model. For more details on using LangChain, refer to the official LangChain documentation.
